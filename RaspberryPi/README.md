## Raspberry Pi Resources

#### Recommended Installation Guide
Use the Raspberry Pi Foundation's [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) installer. It's the easiest install method, and it works for SD cards up to 32 GB.
1. Format your SD card to FAT
  * When you insert it into your computer, the window to format it may appear immediately.
  * The FAT option may say FAT32. That's fine.
2. Download the NOOBS zip from the link above
3. Unzip it
4. Copy the contents to the SD card
    * Unzipping the zip file may create a new folder with all the files in it. You want to copy all the files, but not that folder.
    * There is a file called INSTRUCTIONS-README.txt. If you see that file, you're at the right folder level to select all the files and copy them to the SD card.
5. Plug the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, hook it up, turn it on, and follow the installer prompts.
