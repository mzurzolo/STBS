## This is a collection of projects, code snippets, descriptions, and guides that focuses on building usable skills quickly.

We all learned to speak before we knew parts of speech; we could all add before we knew what "base-10 number system" meant. We learned by doing, and the 'boring stuff' came later. This collection attempts to apply that principal to engineering tools: primarily linux and python.
