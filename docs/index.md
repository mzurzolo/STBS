#### Skip the boring stuff is a collection of projects, code snippets, descriptions, and guides that focuses on building usable skills quickly.
We all learned to speak before we knew parts of speech; we could all add before we knew what "base-10 number system" meant. We learned by doing, and the 'boring stuff' came later. This collection attempts to apply that principal to engineering tools: primarily linux and python.

### Getting Started

1. Linux

      1.a. [On a Flash Drive](Linux/README.md)

      1.b. [On a Raspberry Pi](RaspberryPi/README.md)

2. [Python](Python/README.md)
### Projects
