## Python Resources

#### Recommended Python Distribution
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is a quick, easy way to get python and a really useful collection of packages.
Suggestions:
During install, select the option to install for your user only, not all users (system wide)
Spyder is a great IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to start with.
