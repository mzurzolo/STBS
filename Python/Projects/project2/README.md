## Project 2

### If you haven't already, please read [project notes](../README.md).

## Goal: Generate a plot in a more manual way than project1. Work more closely with matplotlib.pyplot

In this example, I will be showing you how to take a data file in CSV format (comma-separated values) and generate a chart with it. I will present a more explicit, step-by-step way to do it than project1. This way requires more code to be written, but it gives you more control over what's happening.

## Project Setup:

- Open a terminal window
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd ~/STBS/Python/Projects/project2`
- Run the Project Setup Script: `source work_here.sh`

## Exercises:

- Change the color and line style of the graphs
- Add a title and axis labels
- Replace inputs/data.csv with your own data. You can create a table in Excel (or Google Sheets) and export it as a csv.
