## Project 1

### If you haven't already, please read [project notes](../README.md).

## Goal: First project setup, generate plot.

In this example, I will be showing you how to take a data file in CSV format (comma-separated values) and generate a chart with it. I will present one way to do it here, and a different way to do it in project2.

## Project Setup:

- Open a terminal window
- Navigate to the project directory:

`cd ~/STBS/Python/Projects/project1`
- Run the Project Setup Script: `source work_here.sh`

## Using Jupyter Lab:

- Jupyter lab allows you to have everything you need in one browser.
- When you first launch jupyter lab, it should look something like this: ![jupyterlab start](../Pictures/jupyterlab_start.png)
- There is a file explorer on the left-hand side, and a launcher on the right.
- Launch a new terminal ![jupyterlab launcher](../Pictures/jupyterlab_terminal.png)
- Double-click project1.py in the file explorer on the left to open it ![open_project](../Pictures/jupyterlab_open_project1.py.png)
- You can re-arrange the terminal window by dragging the terminal tab
- I like mine at the bottom. ![jupyterlab_drag_tab](../Pictures/jupyterlab_drag_tab.png) ![jupyterlab_splitscreen](../Pictures/jupyterlab_splitscreen.png)
- Having a split window like this makes it easier to edit the code you're working on, save changes, and test them. Just type `python project1.py` and hit enter to run the project. ![jupyterlab_run_project](../Pictures/jupyterlab_run_project.png)

## Exercises:

- Change the color and line style of the graphs
- Add a title and axis labels
- Replace inputs/data.csv with your own data. You can create a table in Excel (or Google Sheets) and export it as a csv.
