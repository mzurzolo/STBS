### Project 1

##### If you haven't already, please read [project notes](../README.md).

#### Goal: First project setup, generate plot.

In this example, I will be showing you how to take a data file in
CSV format (comma-separated values) and generate a chart with it. I will present two ways to do it, using two different python packages.

#### Project Setup:
* Open a terminal window
* Navigate to the project directory: `cd STBS/Python/Projects/project1`
* Run the Project Setup Script: `source work_here.sh`
* Launch Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
