## Project 5

### If you haven't already, please read [project notes](../README.md).

## Goal: Create your own project.

In this example, I only include a template.

## Project Setup:

- Open a terminal window
- Navigate to the STBS directory: `cd ~/STBS`
- Get STBS Updates: `git pull`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd ~/STBS/Python/Projects/project5`
- Run the Project Setup Script: `source work_here.sh`
- Collect data
- Export the spreadsheet as a csv file
  - `File` -> `Download` -> `Comma-separated values (.csv)` for Google Sheets
  - `File` -> `Save as...` -> `Text CSV (.csv)` for LibreOffice Calc

## Files:

- Extra project files can be downloaded from the Google Drive [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19lm31blakFJes99gz_KqloNM8IEqbpLa?usp=sharing)
